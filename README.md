# Installation Guide

This config requires **packer**. It can be installed with this command:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim \
  ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/opt/packer.nvim
```

Once **packer** is installed open nvim

```bash
nvim
```

Then run `:PackerSync` and `:PackerInstall` and restart
